Build your own modulation and pitch bend wheels into a small box for use where space is limited. <br>

## Description:
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The "ModPit Wheel Box" is a class-compliant USB MIDI controller built in an afternoon with parts scavenged from a cheap MIDI keyboard from Amazon and **no soldering required**.  The most difficult part of the build is figuring out how to mount the parts into something small and useful.  But, I have designed and shared a STL files for a 3D printable box which fits everything perfectly.

There is no code involved, since the MIDI keyboard we use is ready to plug-n-play.

### Why?:

I produce mostly on the Akai MPC platform and quite enjoy how easily the 16 pads are tuned to any key making it quick and easy to keep musical ideas flowing.  I understand keyboard and some basic music theory, but not nearly enough to move quickly on one.  Also, space on my studio desk is very limited.

While I cannot move quickly across a keyboard, I do quite enjoy the accenting possible with the pitch bend and modulation wheels (and sustain pedals - more on this later) they can provide.  So, I went searching for a MIDI capable dedicated wheel controller box and found only that others were looking for the same.  I began to wonder if I could make my own, and here we are.
